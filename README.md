Python 3 library for the Azure Kinect DK sensor-SDK.

## Similar solutions
Part of the ideas in this repository are taken from following repositories:
* [pyk4a](https://github.com/etiennedub/pyk4a): Really nice and clean Python3 wrapper for the Kinect Azure SDK.

* [Azure-Kinect-Python](https://github.com/hexops/Azure-Kinect-Python): More complete library using ctypes as in this repository, however, examples about how to use the library are missing and the library is harder to use.

The objective of this repository is to combine the strong points of both repositories by creating a easy to use library that allows the use of most of the functions of the Kinect Azure. Also, to create sample programs to showcase the uses of the library

## Prerequisites
* [Azure-Kinect-Sensor-SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Kinect-Sensor-SDK): required to build this library.
  To use the SDK, refer to the installation instructions [here](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Kinect-Sensor-SDK).
* **ctypes**: required to read the library.
* **numpy**: required for the matrix calculations
* **opencv-python**: Required for the image transformations and visualization.

## How to use this library

* The library has **been tested in Windows 10 and Ubuntu 20.04** with the Kinect Azure SDK 1.4.0 and 1.4.1, it should also work with other operating systems.

  - **Windows:** When using the pyKinectAzure class, it requires the **path to the k4a.dll module**, make sure that the path is the correct one for your Kinect Azure SDK version. By default the path (**module_path**) is set to  ```C:\\Program Files\\Azure Kinect SDK v1.4.0\\sdk\\windows-desktop\\amd64\\release\\bin\\k4a.dll```.

  - **Linux:** When using the pyKinectAzure class, it requires the **path to the k4a.so module**, make sure that the path is the correct one for your Kinect Azure SDK version. When using Linux set **module_path** to  ```/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libk4a.so```, please follow the [instruction](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Kinect-Sensor-SDK/blob/develop/docs/usage.md) from microsoft to install the right packages.
  
   - **Nvidia Jetson:** When using the pyKinectAzure class, it requires the **path to the k4a.so module**, make sure that the path is the correct one for your Kinect Azure SDK version. When using Nvidia Jetson set **module_path** to to  ```'/usr/lib/aarch64-linux-gnu/libk4a.so'```, please follow the [instruction](https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Kinect-Sensor-SDK/blob/develop/docs/usage.md) from microsoft to install the right packages.

* The **pyKinectAzure** class is a wrapper around the **_k4a.py** module to make the library more understandable. However, the **pyKinectAzure** class still contains few methods from the Kinect Azure SDK

* The **_k4a.py** module already contains all the methods in the Kinect Azure SDK. So, for more advanced of the Kinect Azure SDK check the **_k4a.py** module.

## Examples

For an example on how to obtain and visualize the depth data from the Azure Kinect DK check the **exampleDepthImageOpenCV.py** script.
```
git clone https://github.com/ibaiGorordo/pyKinectAzure.git
cd pyKinectAzure/examples
python exampleDepthImageOpenCV.py
```

Also, there is an example to obtain and visualize the smooth depth from the Azure Kinect DK check the **exampleSmoothDepthImageOpenCV.py** script.
```
python exampleSmoothDepthImageOpenCV.py
```
> note: when you are dealing on the linux platform, please insure that the user have permission to the usb devices, or always execute under the root permission by adding `sudo` ahead.
